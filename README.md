### About
This is the ***Steganography and Cryptography*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of encryption is called steganography. The message will be hiding in a picture on some web site, and only those who know will understand it. For maximum security, the message itself can be encrypted, as well.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
</ul>

### Learning outcomes
<p>While creating a program for encrypting and concealing a message within an image, you will learn about files, image handling, lists, and logical functions. In addition, you will learn basic yet strong encryption.</p>
