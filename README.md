# Steganography and Cryptography
Completed tutorial project from [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org/)

<h3>About</h3>
You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image.
This kind of encryption is called steganography.
The message will be hiding in a picture on some web site, and only those who know will understand it.
For maximum security, the message itself can be encrypted, as well.

<h3>Learning outcomes</h3>

While creating a program for encrypting and concealing a message within an image, you will learn about files, image handling, lists, and logical functions.
In addition, you will learn basic yet strong encryption.
